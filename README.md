# CSCI-421

#Contains the beginning of a steganography project that was abandoned and a rudimentary DNSSnooping file, named dnsSnoop.bat.

#No installation required for the dnsSnoop.bat, all you have to so is download the file and launch it in whatever folder you want or just your desktop. The file will execute and print results to the current location of the .bat. The program will prompt you to put in a domain name, such as youtube.com, and will execute a command to "snoop" at that domain. The program in incredibly lightweight, only 11 lines of code. The only requirement for the program is it written for Windows machines. A Linux version is in the works.

#I'd recommend not cloning the directory to avoid all the steganography stuff you probably don't want in your repo.
