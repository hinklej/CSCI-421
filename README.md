# CSCI-421

#Contains the beginning of a steganography project that was abandoned and a rudimentary DNSSnooping file, named dnsSniff.py.

#No installation required for the dnsSniff.py, all you have to so is download the file and launch it in whatever folder you want or just your desktop. The file will execute and print results to the current location of the .py. The program runs in the background, skimming all the information of what you're looking at in an internet browser. All data is saved to a text file that is named "output.txt" as a hardcode. A Windows version is in the works.

#I'd recommend not cloning the directory to avoid all the steganography stuff you probably don't want in your repo.
